Aim:
To read and write animation data to a text file.

Limitations:
    Effective only on same rig. Inbetween keys if kept will help in transferring the animation more accurately.

Usage:
Used for transferring animation from a low poly workable model to the high resolution renderable version of the same model.

1. Open the Script Editor in Maya.
2. Copy the script to the Python tab.
3. Change the filepath on line numbers 6 and 96 to the same file.
4. Execute the script using Command>Execute
